# Wii-Scale

Wii-Scale turns your Wii Balance Board into a digital scale. Wii-Scale will automatically find your Wii Balance Board when you press the red sync button under it. All you have to do is just stand on it :) No boring console interface, watch your weight being calculated in realtime on a beautiful web insterface.

You can also create multiple users for the whole family and see each members weight history. Wii-Scale runs on Linux and it also runs on a Raspberry Pi.

Wii-Scale is based on python, node.js, AngularJS and communicates over the lightning fast WebSocket protocol.

## Usage

To connect to your Wii Balance Board you'll only need to press the green "Connect" button on the website and press the red sync button on your Wii Balance Board. The red sync button is located under the battery hatch. Wii-Scale will stay on an listen for your Wii Balance Board and promt you what to do in the web interface.

The weight is calculated by taking the mean of 50 readings. Wii-Scale will ignore all weights under 30 kg to give you the most accurate reading possible. Oh, and all this will take about 3 seconds.

## Installation

Wii-Scale runs most likely only on Linux. Follow these guides to install Wii-Scale on Ubuntu or Raspberry Pi:

- [How to install Wii-Scale on Ubuntu](https://github.com/aelveborn/Wii-Scale/wiki/Guide:-How-to-install-Wii-Scale-on-Ubuntu)
- [How to install Wii-Scale on Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/aelveborn/Wii-Scale/wiki/Guide:-How-to-install-Wii-Scale-on-Raspberry-Pi)

To communicate with your Wii Balance Board you'll need a bluetooth 2.0 or 2.1 compatible device. You can find [compatible devices here](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/List_of_Working_Bluetooth_Devices). Wii-Scale is based on the following dependencies `Python 2`, `Python-pip` and `Node.js with npm` and `BlueZ` bluetooth stack.


### Install Wii-Scale

Download latest version of Wii-Scale:

	cd <your-directory>/
	git clone https://github.com/aelveborn/Wii-Scale.git --depth 1
	cd Wii-Scale/

Run install:

	sudo python setup.py install
	sudo npm install --production
	grunt build


### Run

	npm start

Now the web server and Wii-Scale should be up and running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Configuration (optional)

You can configure a different host, port, Wii Balance Board bluetooth address and calibration.

### Access the web interface from other computers

To open up the web server to be accessable from the outside, like if you'll running Wii-Scale on an Raspberry Pi or a server:

	npm config set wii-scale:host 0.0.0.0

### Web server port

Define a custom port for the webserver (default is 8080):

	npm config set wii-scale:port 8080

### Webserver host

Define a different host for the webserver (default is localhost):

	npm config set wii-scale:host localhost

### Pair Wii Balance Board

If you have paired your Wii balance board with your computer or Raspberry Pi you'll need to set the address to your Wii Balance Boards MAC address. If the MAC address is configured Wii-Scale wont scan for your Wii balance board, since it should be paired :). To pair your Wii Balance Board you can run `sudo python wii-scale/bind-setup.py`. You'll also need to configure Wii-Scale with your Wii Balance Boards MAC-address:

	npm config set wii-scale:address 00:00:00:00:00


### Calibrate Wii-Scale

If the scales weight is off by any amout you can calibrate it by your own by setting the calibration i Kg. So `npm config set wii-scale:calibrate 2`will add 2kg to your weight, default is set to 0.

	npm config set wii-scale:calibrate 0


## Update

To update Wii-Scale, grab the latest version from github:

	cd <your-directory>/Wii-Scale
	git pull origin master

Update Wii-Scale by running install:

	sudo python setup.py install
	sudo npm install --production


## For developers

If you whant to make a code contribution, run a `grunt clean-build` before you commit and create a pull request to the dev branch. This is important since the dev branch is used for testing.

### Developer install

If you are a developer you can install Wii-Scale with all developer dependecies:

	sudo python setup.py install
	sudo npm install

If you are a developer and whant to contribute to the project, then this is some nice commands to know about.

Run:

	npm start

Run all tests:

	npm test

Grunt commands:

	grunt
	grunt build
	grunt clean-build

`grunt` will run `grunt watch` and build the whole project.
